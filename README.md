## Project Overview
#### Accurately predicting calories burnt is essential for fitness and health monitoring applications. This project leverages machine learning techniques to create a reliable predictive model.
## Data Preprocessing
#### - Handled missing values in the dataset.
#### - Handled duplicated rows in the dataset.
#### - Handled datatype of features in the dataset.
#### - Handled outliers in the dataset.
#### - Transformed categorical features into numerical format.
## Exploratory Data Analysis
#### Visualization techniques were used to better understand the data, including:
#### - Distribution of calories accoring to all feature.
#### - Analysis of key features affecting calories burnt (e.g., Height , weight , Body_temp).
#### - The highest percentage of calories in male.
#### - Correlation Between Features.
## Modeling
#### I used the Random Forest nd XGBoost algorithms for this task,Tuned hyperparameters to enhance model performance.
## Results
#### Achieved an accuracy of 99%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Random Forest and XGBoost models in predicting calorie burn.
#### mean_squared_error was calculated to evaluate model performance in predicting calories.
## Requirements
#### Python 3.x , Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost.
